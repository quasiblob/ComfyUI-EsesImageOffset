## Description

The 'Eses Image Offset' node offers basic image offsetting capabilities within ComfyUI. It allows shifting image and mask content horizontally and/or vertically, with an option to wrap content around the canvas edges for a tiling effect. 

üí°This node offsets both the image and an optional mask as input.

üí°Node also outputs applied X and Y offsets, and a descriptive information string.

## Features

* **Image and Mask Offsetting**: Shift both image and an optional mask horizontally and/or vertically.
* **Wrap Around Option**: Choose to wrap content around the canvas edges for a tiling effect, or fill newly exposed areas with a specified color.
* **Fill Color Control**: Define the fill color for areas exposed by offsetting when the "wrap around" option is off.
* **Mask Inversion**: Option to invert the output mask.
* **Informative Output**: Provides the applied offsets and an information string detailing the transformation.


## Requirements

* PyTorch ‚Äì (you should have this if you have ComfyUI installed).
* PIL (Pillow) ‚Äì (usually included with ComfUI).
* Numpy ‚Äì (usually included with ComfUI).


## Installation

1.  **Navigate to your ComfyUI custom nodes directory:**
    ```
    ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
    ```

2.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/quasiblob/EsesImageOffset.git
    ```

3.  **Restart ComfyUI:**
    * After restarting, the "Eses Image Offset" node will be available in the "Eses Nodes/Image" category.

## Usage

* Connect an image and/or a mask to the node.
* Adjust the `offset_x` and `offset_y` parameters to shift the content.
* Toggle `wrap_around` to enable or disable tiling.
* Set `fill_color` if `wrap_around` is "Off".
* Choose `invert_mask_output` to invert the resulting mask.


## Inputs

* **offset\_x** (`INT`, *required*): Horizontal offset value. Default is 0, range from -4096 to 4096.
* **offset\_y** (`INT`, *required*): Vertical offset value. Default is 0, range from -4096 to 4096.
* **wrap\_around** (`["Off", "On"]`, *required*): Determines if the image content wraps around the edges.
* **fill\_color** (`STRING`, *required*): RGB or RGBA color string (e.g., "0,0,0" for black, "255,255,255,128" for semi-transparent white).
* **invert\_mask\_output** (`["No", "Yes"]`, *required*): If "Yes", the output mask will be inverted.
* **image** (`IMAGE`, *optional*): The input image to be offset.
* **mask** (`MASK`, *optional*): An optional mask to be offset alongside the image.


## Outputs

* **IMAGE** (`IMAGE`): The processed image after applying the offset and fill.
* **MASK** (`MASK`): The processed mask after applying the offset and inversion.
* **offset\_x** (`INT`): The X offset that was applied.
* **offset\_y** (`INT`): The Y offset that was applied.
* **info** (`STRING`): A descriptive string detailing the applied transformations.
